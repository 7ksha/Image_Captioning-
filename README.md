# üß† Image Captioning with CNN + LSTM + Attention Mechanism  
> *Implementation based on "Deep Learning Approaches Based on Transformer Architectures for Image Captioning Tasks"*

This project implements an **image captioning system** using a combination of **CNN-based image encoder**, **LSTM-based decoder**, and a **soft attention mechanism**. The model is trained and evaluated on the **Flickr8k dataset**.

The architecture follows the principles outlined in the research paper, including:
- Use of **cross-entropy loss**
- Training with **Adam optimizer**
- Evaluation using standard metrics like **BLEU-4**, **METEOR**, and **CIDEr**

While this notebook does not implement full transformer-based models (like ViT or DeiT), it provides a solid baseline and foundation for further exploration into vision-language tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Choices & Implementation Strategy

### 1. Model Selection
- Chose **EfficientNetB7** as the image encoder due to its balance of performance and computational efficiency.
- Used **LSTM + Attention** instead of Vision Transformers (as in the paper) to build a working baseline before moving to more complex architectures.

### 2. Data Processing
- Applied preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, filtering non-alphabetic characters, and adding `startseq`/`endseq` tokens.
- Used `Tokenizer` and `pad_sequences` for text encoding.

### 3. Custom Data Generator
- Built a `Keras.utils.Sequence` generator to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Implemented **teacher forcing strategy** during training.

### 4. Greedy Decoding
- Generated captions using greedy decoding (can be extended to beam search later).
- Visualized generated captions over sample test images.

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using **BLEU-4**, **METEOR**, and **CIDEr**.
- Compared results with values reported in the original paper.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hyperparameters Used

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Batch Size | 64 | Good balance between memory and speed |
| Epochs | 20 | Limited by runtime; higher epochs may improve |
| Optimizer | Adam | Matches best result in paper |
| Loss Function | Categorical Cross-Entropy | Most effective according to experiments |
| Max Caption Length | Dynamic (based on dataset) | Ensured all sequences are covered |
| Embedding Size | 256 | Moderate size for better generalization |
| LSTM Units | 256 | Sufficient for learning long-term dependencies |
| Dropout Rate | 0.5 | Prevents overfitting |
| Learning Rate | Default (from Adam) | Can be fine-tuned later |
| Beam Width (for future) | N/A (greedy used) | Planned improvement |

## üì¶ Dataset Description

### Dataset: **Flickr8k**
- Contains **8,091 images**
- Each image has **5 human-written captions**
- Publicly available at [Kaggle - Flickr8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Cleaned captions (removed special characters, lowercase)
- Tokenized and padded sequences
- Added `startseq` and `endseq` tokens
- Extracted features using EfficientNetB7

## üß† Model Architecture

### Encoder:
- **EfficientNetB7** pretrained on ImageNet
- Output shape: `(batch_size, 2560)` (global average pooling output)

### Decoder:
- **Embedding Layer**: Maps words to dense vectors
- **LSTM Layer**: Processes word sequence context
- **Attention Mechanism**: Computes weights over image features
- **Output Layer**: Softmax over vocabulary

```python
# Example structure
input_image = Input(shape=(2560,))
input_caption = Input(shape=(max_length,))

# Embedding
caption_embedding = Embedding(vocab_size, 256)(input_caption)

# Attention
attention_output = Dense(256)(input_image)
...

# LSTM + Context Fusion
merged = concatenate([feature_vector, hidden_state])
output = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(merged)

model = Model(inputs=[input_image, input_caption], outputs=output)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Training Pipeline

### Feature Extraction:
- Used EfficientNetB7 to extract features
- Saved them in memory for faster access

### Tokenization:
- Built vocabulary using Keras Tokenizer
- Filtered out rare words

### Training:
- Used `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Trained for 20 epochs
- Monitored validation loss

### Inference:
- Greedy decoding implemented
- Displayed 9 images with generated captions
